**Ex 2.1** Suppose each of K-classes has an associated target *t<sub>k</sub>*,
which is a vector of all zeros, except a one in the *k*th position. Show that
classifying to the largest element of *yhat* amounts to choosing the closest
target, *min<sub>k</sub>||t<sub>k</sub> - yhat||*, if the elements of *yhat*
sum to one.
